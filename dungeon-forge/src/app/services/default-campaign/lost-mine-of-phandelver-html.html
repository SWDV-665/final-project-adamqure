<h2>The Dungeon Master</h2>
<p>The Dungeon Master (DM) has a special role in the <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> game.</p>
<p>The DM is a <b>referee</b>. When it's not clear what ought to happen next, the DM decides how to apply the rules and keep the story going.</p>
<p>The DM is a <b>narrator</b>. The DM sets the pace of the story and presents the various challenges and encounters the players must overcome. The DM is the players' interface to the D&D world, as well as the one who reads (and sometimes also writes) the adventure and decscribes what happens in response to the characters' actions.</p>
<p>The DM <b>plays monsters</b>. The DM plays the monsters and villains the adventurers battle against, choosing their actions and rolling dice for their attacks. The DM also plays the part of all the other characters the players meet in the course of their adventurers, like the prisoner in the goblin lair or the inkeeper in town.</p>
<p>Who should be the DM for your gaming group? Whoever wants to be! The person who has the most drive to pull a group together and start up a game often ends up being the DM by default, but that doesn't have to be the case.</p>
<p>Although the DM controls the monsters and villains in the adventure, the relationship between the players and the DM isn’t adversarial. The DM ’s job is to challenge the characters with interesting encounters and tests, keep the game moving, and apply the rules fairly.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember about being a good DM is that the rules are a tool to help you have a good time. The rules aren’t in charge. You’re the DM— you’re in charge of the game. Guide the play experience and the use of the rules so that everybody has fun.</p>
<p>Many players of Dungeons & Dragons find that being the DM is the best part of the game. With the information in this adventure, you’ll be prepared to take on that role for your group.</p>
